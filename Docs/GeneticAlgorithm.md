# Genetic Algorithm with GPU Acceleration*

- **Objective**: Implement a CUDA-optimized genetic algorithm for solving high-dimensional optimization problems (e.g., route planning, scheduling).
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Population evaluation in parallel.
  - CUDA-based selection, crossover, mutation operations.
  - Dynamic memory management for evolving solutions.

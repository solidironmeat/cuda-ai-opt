# Sparse Matrix Optimization for AI Workloads

- **Objective**: Create CUDA routines for efficient sparse matrix multiplication in NLP or GNN workloads.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - CSR/COO format support in CUDA.
  - Warp-level primitives for irregular memory access.
  - Performance benchmarks against cuSPARSE.
